Bloomberg has created sentiment data based on news stories about companies since 2010. Over time, the data set has been further 
expanded through the addition of more sources for news stories, other entities, as well as sentiment on social media. The Bloomberg 
data includes both a sentiment score of -1 or +1 (-1 is bad, and +1 is good) and a confidence value between 1 and 100, where 1 
means almost no confidence, and 100 means high confidence. For the demo script, the sentiment score and confidence are multiplied 
to adjust the total confidence score. I divide the final value by 100 to keep the range similar to the other two indices, but this 
is optional.


The sentiment stream needs to be initialized as a function:
@classmethod
def register_event_streams(cls, md, service, account):
        return {'!sentiment/stocktwits': 'on_stocktwits'}

Queries over longer periods of time, prior to the start of the stock market day, can be made in on_start and on_strategy_start

data = service.query_data('!sentiment/bloomberg/story/news', self.symbol, start_timestamp=md.market_open_time - service.time_interval(hours = sentiment_hours_prior ))

In this particular example, Bloomberg data is queried over a certain number of hours (the variable sentiment_hours_prior) before 
market open. You could extend this time further to gain a better idea of the sentiment surrounding a particular stock in the time 
leading up to market open.

The sentiment of a particular stock is updated by a running total, that begins after the initial call and is updated each time a sentiment
event occurs.

def on_stocktwits(self, event, md, order, service, account): 
        if event.field['sentiment_score']!=0:
            print('Change in %s stock twit sentiment of %.2f' % (self.symbol, event.field['sentiment_score']))
            self.st_value+=event.field['sentiment_score']
            print('Current sentiment for %s is %.2f' % (self.symbol, self.st_value))


The value self.bb_value is a consistently updated value that represents the current net bloomberg sentiment for a stock.
