Stock twits are a financially-themed social media platform, and the stock twit sentiment scores stem directly from this platform. 
It will tend to have a much higher volume of comments and sentiment updates, but with a smaller impact that more traditional news 
articles. You can read more about stock twits here:

The Stock Twit data simply includes a sentiment score of a decimal value between -1 and +1, with -1 being the worst possible 
sentiment score and +1 being the best.

The sentiment stream needs to be initialized as a function:
@classmethod
    def register_event_streams(cls, md, service, account):
        return {'!sentiment/stocktwits': 'on_stocktwits'}

Queries over longer periods of time, prior to the start of the stock market day, can be made in on_start and on_strategy_start

data = service.query_data('!sentiment/stocktwits', self.symbol, start_timestamp=md.market_open_time - service.time_interval(hours=sentiment_hours_prior))
Score = 0
for item in data:
    if item['sentiment_score'] != 0:
        Score += item['sentiment_score']
self.st_value = Score

In this particular example, Stock Twit data is queried over a certain number of hours (the variable sentiment_hours_prior) before 
market open. The for loop then loops over all sentiment over those periods and adds them to the self.st_value element, which 
represents the net sentiment at the market open. You could extend this time further to gain a better idea of the sentiment 
surrounding a particular stock in the time leading up to market open.

The sentiment of a particular stock is updated by a running total, that begins after the initial call and is updated each time 
a sentiment event occurs.

def on_stocktwits(self, event, md, order, service, account):
    if event.field['sentiment_score'] != 0:
        self.st_value += event.field['sentiment_score']

The value self.st_value is a consistently updated value that represents the current net alexandria sentiment for a stock.
